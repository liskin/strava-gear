Simple, yet powerful, local and open-source gear tracker for Strava. Uses
[strava-offline][] to keep a local database of activities and then reads
rules such as when a chain was replaced or that a certain hashtag means a
different set of wheels was used, and computes the wear (distance ridden and
time used) of all components.

Compared to [Strava My Gear][]:

* unlimited number of components
* tracks wear of components swapped from one bike to another, or taken off
  temporarily
* hashtags for temporary component changes (race wheels, bikepacking bags, …)
* easy and reversible editing of maintenance history (it's just YAML, and you
  can put it under [version control][git])

Planned, not yet implemented features:

* [configurable alerts that a component might be worn out and needs servicing
  or replacing](https://github.com/liskin/strava-gear/issues/3)

## Installation

Using [pipx][]:

```
pipx ensurepath
pipx install "strava-gear[strava]"
```

Alternatively, if you don't need the isolated virtualenv that [pipx][]
provides, feel free to just:

```
pip install "strava-gear[strava]"
```

If you've already installed [strava-offline][] and use it separately, you can
omit the `[strava]` bit to avoid installing strava-offline twice.

## Setup and usage

* Run `strava-gear-sync` (or `strava-offline sqlite` if you chose to install
  [strava-offline][] separately) to synchronize activities metadata to a local
  sqlite database. This takes a while: first time a couple dozen seconds, then
  it syncs incrementally which only takes a few seconds each time. Add `-v` to
  see progress.

  The first time you do this, it will open Strava in a browser and ask for
  permissions. Should you run into any trouble at this point, consult
  [strava-offline][] readme or open an issue.

  If you make changes to older activities (to assign a different bike to a
  ride, for example), you may need a `--full` re-sync rathen than the default
  incremental one. See the [note about incremental synchronization](https://github.com/liskin/strava-offline#note-about-incremental-synchronization)
  for a detailed explanation.

* Create `~/.config/strava_gear/rules.yaml` (the location will be different on
  Windows/MacOS, please consult `--help` or just use `--rules` explicitly) and
  define components and rules. The complete format of the `rules.yaml` file is
  documented in [Rules syntax](#rules-syntax), but a good start might be
  something like this:

  ```yaml
  rules:
  - gravel:
      casette: grx-hg800
      chain: grx-chain-1
  - since: 2021-01-01
    gravel:
      chain: grx-chain-2
  ```

  This defines two rules:

  1. The first one has no `since:`, and defines the initial configuration: a
     bike named "gravel" in Strava starts with two components in two roles,
     respectively. The first component, "gravel-hg800", is assigned the
     "casette" role and "gravel-chain-1" is assigned to "chain".

  2. Then, on 2021-01-01, we replaced the chain. This is expressed as a rule
     with `since: 2021-01-01` that assigns component "gravel-chain-2" to the
     "chain" role of our "gravel" bicycle.

* Run `strava-gear`:

  ```
  $ strava-gear
  bike    role     id           name              km    hour  first … last
  ------  -------  -----------  -----------  -------  ------  -----------------------
  gravel  casette  grx-hg800    grx-hg800    19462.0   913.9  2016-01-12 … 2021-09-11
  gravel  chain    grx-chain-2  grx-chain-2   2236.6   113.5  2021-01-18 … 2021-09-11
  ```

  As you see, strava-gear displays the components currently assigned to your
  gravel bike and their computed usage: distance, hours, first and last use.

  You'll also notice that the component ids are shown twice. This is because
  if you [declare your components explicitly](#rules-syntax), you can assign
  long names to them, such as "Shimano CN-HG701-11 with Quick-Link". This
  column can be hidden using the `--hide-name` [command-line
  option](#command-line-options).

  If you want to see all components regardless of their current assignment,
  ordered by last usage, just ask for the `components` report:

  ```
  $ strava-gear --report=components
  id           name              km    hour  first … last
  -----------  -----------  -------  ------  -----------------------
  grx-chain-1  grx-chain-1  17225.5   800.4  2016-01-12 … 2020-12-12
  grx-hg800    grx-hg800    19462.0   913.9  2016-01-12 … 2021-09-11
  grx-chain-2  grx-chain-2   2236.6   113.5  2021-01-18 … 2021-09-11
  ```

  There are more ways to customize the output (and input), use `--help` or see
  [Command line options](#command-line-options).

## Rules syntax

The rules for strava-gear are by default loaded from
`~/.config/strava_gear/rules.yaml` (the location will be different on
Windows/MacOS, please consult `--help` or just use `--rules` explicitly).
Here's an informal description of what goes inside:

```yaml
# The rules section is mandatory, and there must be at least one rule.
rules:

  # The general format of a rule is:
  - since: date  # ISO-8601 format, defaults to unix epoch if omitted
    # Bicycle id, name or alias (see further)
    bicycle:
      # Role can be anything like "chain", "rear-tyre", …
      role: component1_id
      role2: component2_id
      # …
    # Multiple bicycles and hashtags can be specified in one rule:
    bicycle2:
      role: component3_id
      # …
    "#hashtag1":
      role: component4_id
      # …
    # …

  # Typically, the first rule will specify initial component assigment,
  # for example:
  - gravel:
      frame: specialized-diverge-frame
      tyre-front: specialized-roubaix-pro-1
      tyre-rear: specialized-roubaix-pro-2
      chain: chain11-1
    road:
      frame: isaac-element-frame
      tyre-front: schwalbe-one-1
      tyre-rear: schwalbe-one-2
      chain: chain11-2
  # Note that this doesn't need to be at the top of the file. The rules are
  # sorted by their "since" fields anyway. It's totally okay to first specify
  # all rules for the gravel bike, then rules for the road bike, and so on.

  # Most rules will then specify a "since" field and some component changes:
  - since: 2020-02-01
    gravel:
      chain: chain11-3
  - since: 2020-08-01
    gravel:
      chain: chain11-4
    road:
      chain: chain11-5
  # and so on and so forth…

  # When null (a YAML keyword) is specified in place of a component,
  # it means the component was taken off the bike:
  - since: 2019-11-01
    road:
      mudguards: crud-roadracer-mk3  # mudguards for the winter
  - since: 2020-03-01
    road:
      mudguards: null                # but take them off as soon as possible!

  # Components can be moved from one bike to another without explicitly
  # unassigning them from the first bike:
  - since: 2021-01-01
    gravel:
      # These are automatically unassigned from road bike:
      tyre-front: schwalbe-one-1
      tyre-rear: schwalbe-one-2

  # For temporary component assignments, we can define hashtag rules:
  - "#cx-tyres":
      tyre-front: schwalbe-x-one-1
      tyre-rear: schwalbe-x-one-2
  - since: 2020-06-01
    "#cx-tyres":
      tyre-front: schwalbe-x-one-3
      tyre-rear: schwalbe-x-one-4

  # These temporarily change component assignments whenever the given hashtag
  # appears in the name (not description!) of an activity.
  #
  # Note that null component in a hashtag rule only means that the hashtag no
  # longer assigns that component, it doesn't result in temporary unassignment
  # whenever that hashtag is used in an activity name. If you need that, use a
  # dummy component id.

  # Special virtual hashtags `#column=value` are available for all columns in
  # the input database/csv. These can for example be used to define component
  # assignments for indoor trainer rides from Zwift, Rouvy, etc.:
  - "#type=VirtualRide":
      tyre-front: wahoo-kickr-climb
      tyre-rear: wahoo-kickr
  - "#commute=1":
      shoes: chrome-industries-kursk

  # Dates are interpreted as midnight in your current time zone.
  # Time can be specified too, if you swapped components in between rides in
  # one day:
  - since: 2020-05-01T14:00
  # If you travel between timezones and need strava-gear to give consistent
  # results, it's a good idea to specify the timezone as well:
  - since: 2020-05-01T14:00+02:00  # Central European Summer Time

# The components section is optional, but it's useful to declare component
# names or initial usage (second hand components, usage not tracked in Strava,
# etc.).
components:
  # The key is component id, the value is component name:
  chain11-1: "Shimano CN-HG701-11 (Quick-Link)"

  # To specify initial usage, the value must be an object instead:
  chain11-2:
    name: "Shimano CN-HG701-11 (connecting pin)"
    kms: 1000
    hours: 50

  # A component with same id and name can also be declared explicitly,
  # although it doesn't need to be.
  chain11-3:

# The aliases section can be omitted if you just want to use bike names as
# defined in Strava. If you, however, want to use shorter bike ids, or if
# you often rename your bikes in Strava and want to keep the names stable
# here, you can define aliases explicitly.
aliases:
  city: b123456    # To get these ids, visit https://www.strava.com/settings/gear
  gravel: b234567  # and prepend "b" to the number in the URL of the bike link.
  road: b345678    # Or just look into the strava-offline database. :-)
```
